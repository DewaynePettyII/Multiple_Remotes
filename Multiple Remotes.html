<!-- The "Remote" for a branch is a URL from where your local git repository fetches changes. Your local git repository
is entirly yours, it isn't affective by other people's code until they have pushed their commits to the remote. -->

<!-- Hopefully, you are all using the same remote and everything syncs up, but the remote is just an endpoint. You
could clone the endpoint and switch to a new remote without much issue.  -->

<!-- Whenever you clone a new repository, the default remote is set as origin. You can find the remotes for
any given git repository by running: git remote -v -->

<!-- This will probably display the URL of your main repository on GitHub or whatever service you're usuing. If you
have multiple remotes, they will show up here, too. -->

<!-- With multiple remotes, you can easily push code through a second repository. -->

<!-- Setting up multiple remotes, usuing git this way is actually simple. You add remotes in the same way that you could
push an existing folder, except instead of adding the origin remote, you give it a different name. -->

<!-- When you get an error/fatal: refusing to merge unrelated stories you can pass out a flag to allow
pulling the repository: --allow-unrelated-histories -->

<!-- git remote -v: shows you the origin's URLs -->
<!-- git remote add "_________" gitnub origin URL: adds a Repository Remote  -->
<!-- git pull -->
<!-- git pull "__________" --allow-unrelated-histories: if fatal error pops up -->
<!-- add / commit /  git push "_________" -->
